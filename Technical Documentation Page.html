          <p>Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented, and high-level programming language. It was created by Guido van Rossum during 1985- 1990. Like Perl, Python source code is also available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). This tutorial gives enough understanding on Python programming language.</p>

            <b>Why to learn Python?</b>
            <hr>
          </header>
          <p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.</p>
          
          <p>Python is a MUST for students and working professionals to become a great Software Engineer specially when they are working in Web Development Domain. I will list down some of the key advantages of learning Python:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li><b>Python is Interpreted</b> − Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter. You do not need to compile your program before executing it. This is similar to PERL and PHP.</li>
            
            <li><b>Python is Interactive</b> − You can actually sit at a Python prompt and interact with the interpreter directly to write your programs.</li>
            
            <li><b>Python is Object-Oriented</b> − Python supports Object-Oriented style or technique of programming that encapsulates code within objects.</li>
            
            <li><b>Python is a Beginner's Language</b> − Python is a great language for the beginner-level programmers and supports the development of a wide range of applications from simple text processing to WWW browsers to games.</li>
          </ul>

            <b>Characteristics</b>
            <hr>
          </header>
          <p>Following are important characteristics of Python Programming -</p>
          <ul>
            <li>It supports functional and structured programming methods as well as OOP.</li>
            
            <li>It can be used as a scripting language or can be compiled to byte-code for building large applications.</li>
            
            <li>It provides very high-level dynamic data types and supports dynamic type checking.</li>
            
            <li>It supports automatic garbage collection.</li>
            <li>It can be easily integrated with C, C++, COM, ActiveX, CORBA, and Java.</li>
          </ul>

            <b>Applications</b>
            <hr>
          </header>
          <p>As mentioned before, Python is one of the most widely used language over the web. I'm going to list few of them here:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Easy-to-learn − </b>Python has few keywords, simple structure, and a clearly defined syntax. This allows the student to pick up the language quickly.</li>
            
            <li><b>Easy-to-read − </b>Python code is more clearly defined and visible to the eyes.</li>
            
            <li><b>Easy-to-maintain − </b>Python's source code is fairly easy-to-maintain.</li>
            
            <li><b>A broad standard library − </b>Python's bulk of the library is very portable and cross-platform compatible on UNIX, Windows, and Macintosh.</li>
            
            <li><b>Interactive Mode − </b>Python has support for an interactive mode which allows interactive testing and debugging of snippets of code.</li>
        
            <li><b>Portable − </b>Python can run on a wide variety of hardware platforms and has the same interface on all platforms.</li>
            
            <li><b>Extendable − </b>You can add low-level modules to the Python interpreter. These modules enable programmers to add to or customize their tools to be more efficient.</li>
            
            <li><b>Databases − </b>Python provides interfaces to all major commercial databases.</li>
            
            <li><b>GUI Programming − </b>Python supports GUI applications that can be created and ported to many system calls, libraries and windows systems, such as Windows MFC, Macintosh, and the X Window system of Unix.</li>
            
            <li><b>Scalable − </b>Python provides a better structure and support for large programs than shell scripting.</li>
          </ul>

            <b>Prerequisites</b>
            <hr>
          </header>
          <p>You should have a basic understanding of Computer Programming terminologies. A basic understanding of any of the programming languages is a plus.</p>

            <b>Hello World</b>
            <hr>
          </header>
          <p>Just to give you a little excitement about Python, I'm going to give you a small conventional Python Hello World program.</p>
          
          <code>print ("Hello, World!")</code>

        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
          <header>
            <b>Variables</b>
            <hr>
          </header>
          
          <p>Variables are containers for storing data values.</p>
          
          <p>Unlike other programming languages, Python has no command for declaring a variable.</p>
          
          <p>A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.</p>
          
          <code>x = 5
            y = "John"
            print(x)
            print(y)</code>
          
          <p>Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.<p>
          
          <code>x = 4 # x is of type int
                x = "Sally" # x is now of type str
                print(x)
          </code>
          
          <p>String variables can be declared either by using single or double quotes:</p>
        
          <code>x = "John"
          # is the same as
          x = 'John'</code>
        </section>
        
        <section class="main-section" id="Variable_Names">
          <header>
            <b>Variable Names</b>
            <hr>
          </header>
          
          <p>A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character</li>
            <li>A variable name cannot start with a number</li>
            <li>A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )</li>
            <li>Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)</li>
          </ul>

          <code>#Legal variable names:
          myvar = "John"
          my_var = "John"
          _my_var = "John"
          myVar = "John"
          MYVAR = "John"
          myvar2 = "John"
              
          #Illegal variable names:
          2myvar = "John"
          my-var = "John"
          my var = "John"</code>
